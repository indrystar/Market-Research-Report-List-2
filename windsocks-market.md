<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Windsocks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Mast</li><li>With no Mast</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Windsocks with mast are typically used in places where there is a need for greater visibility of wind direction, such as airports or industrial sites. The mast helps elevate the windsock above obstructions to accurately display wind direction. On the other hand, windsocks without masts are usually used in smaller spaces or where a lower profile is desired. These windsocks are often hung from a stationary object like a building or pole. Both types serve the same purpose of indicating wind direction for safety and operational purposes.</p></p>
