<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Resistant Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inherent Fire-resistant Fabrics</li><li>Treated Fire-resistant Fabrics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire-resistant fabrics are divided into two main types: inherent fire-resistant fabrics and treated fire-resistant fabrics. Inherent fire-resistant fabrics are made with fibers that have natural fire-resistant properties, providing long-lasting protection even after multiple washes. Treated fire-resistant fabrics, on the other hand, are regular fabrics treated with chemicals to enhance their fire-resistant properties. While both types offer protection against flames and heat, inherent fabrics are generally more durable and reliable in the long run compared to treated fabrics.</p></p>
