<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Graphite Seal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flexible</li><li>Inflexible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical graphite seals are typically categorized into two main market types: flexible and inflexible. Flexible graphite seals are designed to conform to irregular surfaces and provide a tight seal even under varying pressures and temperatures. Inflexible graphite seals, on the other hand, are more rigid and are used in applications where a precise and constant seal is required. Both types of seals have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
