<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Bottles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum bottle</li><li>Non-vacuum bottle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel bottles are commonly divided into two market types: vacuum bottles and non-vacuum bottles. Vacuum bottles maintain the temperature of liquids for extended periods by creating a vacuum-insulated layer that prevents heat transfer. They are ideal for keeping beverages hot or cold for longer durations. On the other hand, non-vacuum bottles do not have this insulated layer and are generally more affordable. While they may not keep liquids at the desired temperature as long as vacuum bottles, they are still a popular choice for everyday use.</p></p>
