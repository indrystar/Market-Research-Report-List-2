<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural tires can be divided into two main types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial tires are designed with cords running at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, providing better traction and reducing soil compaction. Bias tires, on the other hand, have cords that run at an angle to the direction of travel, offering a more rigid construction and higher load-carrying capacity. Both types have their own advantages and are suitable for different farming applications and terrains.</p></p>
