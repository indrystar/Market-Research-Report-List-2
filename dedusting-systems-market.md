<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dedusting Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Central Dedusting System</li><li>Independent Dust Collector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Central Dedusting Systems are designed to collect dust and debris from various sources within a facility and transport it to a central location for disposal. This system is ideal for large industrial settings where multiple machines generate dust simultaneously. On the other hand, Independent Dust Collectors are standalone units that are used to capture and filter dust in localized areas or single machines. These systems are commonly found in smaller operations or where specific dust control is needed. Both systems play a crucial role in maintaining a clean and safe working environment.</p></p>
