<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alkylbenzene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Alkylbenzene</li><li>Branched Alkylbenzene</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alkylbenzene can be divided into two main types: linear alkylbenzene and branched alkylbenzene. Linear alkylbenzene is produced by the reaction of benzene with olefins, creating a straight chain of alkyl groups. This type is commonly used in the production of detergents. On the other hand, branched alkylbenzene is produced from olefins with branching chains, resulting in a more complex molecular structure. Branched alkylbenzene is often used in industries such as lubricants and additives.</p></p>
