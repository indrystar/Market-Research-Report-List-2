<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Germanium Wafer Ge Wafer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conductive Type P-type</li><li>Conductive Type N-type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Germanium wafers come in two main conductive types: P-type and N-type. P-type wafers are doped with elements that provide an excess of "holes," or positive charge carriers. This type is commonly used in electronic devices where a positive charge is needed. N-type wafers, on the other hand, are doped with elements that provide an excess of electrons, or negative charge carriers. These wafers are typically used in devices that require a negative charge. Both types play a crucial role in the semiconductor industry.</p></p>
