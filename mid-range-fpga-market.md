<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mid-Range FPGA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Less Than 28 nm</li><li>28-90 nm</li><li>More Than 90 nm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mid-Range FPGA market can be categorized into three types based on fabrication node size: Less than 28 nm, 28-90 nm, and more than 90 nm. FPGAs with a node size of less than 28 nm offer higher performance and lower power consumption, making them suitable for applications requiring high processing speeds. On the other hand, FPGAs with a node size of 28-90 nm strike a balance between performance and cost. FPGAs with a node size of more than 90 nm are more cost-effective but provide lower performance compared to smaller nodes.</p></p>
