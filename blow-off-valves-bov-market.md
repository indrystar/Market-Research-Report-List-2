<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blow-off Valves (BOV) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two Pressure Signals</li><li>One Pressure Signals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blow-off valves (BOVs) in the market can be categorized into two types based on pressure signals. Two pressure signals BOVs have dual ports that release excess pressure when the throttle closes, preventing compressor surge. On the other hand, one pressure signal BOVs are simpler and work by releasing pressure when the throttle closes, providing effective protection for the turbocharger and engine. Both types are essential in maintaining optimal performance and prolonging the lifespan of turbocharged engines.</p></p>
