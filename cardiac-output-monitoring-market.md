<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Output Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Devices</li><li>Minimally-invasive Devices</li><li>Non-invasive Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac output monitoring market types include invasive devices, minimally-invasive devices, and non-invasive devices. Invasive devices involve inserting a catheter into the blood vessels to directly measure cardiac output. Minimally-invasive devices utilize sensors placed on the skin or in the esophagus to measure cardiac output with less invasion. Non-invasive devices, like Doppler ultrasound or bioimpedance monitors, measure cardiac output without the need for any penetration of the skin or body. Each type of device offers varying levels of invasiveness and accuracy in monitoring cardiac output.</p></p>
