<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Fire Resistant Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flexible fire-resistant sealants are used in building construction to prevent the spread of fire through joints and gaps. There are two main types of flexible fire-resistant sealants: Elastomeric type sealants, which remain flexible even at high temperatures, and intumescent type sealants, which expand when exposed to heat to form a protective char layer. Elastomeric sealants are suitable for areas with high movement, while intumescent sealants are used in areas where fire resistance is the primary concern. Both types play a critical role in maintaining fire safety in buildings.</p></p>
