<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GeOthersmal Electric Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal electric power generation industry consists of three main market types: Dry Steam Stations, Flash Steam Power Stations, and Binary Cycle Stations. Dry Steam Stations extract steam directly from the ground to drive turbines and generate electricity. Flash Steam Power Stations use pressurized hot water from underground reservoirs to produce steam for electricity generation. Binary Cycle Stations pass hot water from underground reservoirs through a heat exchanger, which vaporizes a separate working fluid to drive a turbine and generate power.</p></p>
