<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LAN Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PoE</li><li>Non-PoE</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LAN transformers are classified into two main types: PoE (Power over Ethernet) and non-PoE markets. PoE transformers integrate power supply into the data transmission process, allowing devices to receive power and data through a single cable. This simplifies installation and reduces the need for multiple cables. Non-PoE transformers, on the other hand, focus solely on data transmission without providing power. Both types play a crucial role in networking infrastructure, with PoE transformers being particularly useful for powering devices like IP cameras and wireless access points.</p></p>
